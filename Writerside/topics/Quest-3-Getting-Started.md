# Quest 3 Getting Started

The Quest 3 is simple to get started, let's jump straight into it.

To begin, start by placing the headset over your eyes, and pulling the strap around the back of your head. The straps may be too tight or too loose, so adjust them accordingly. You will also need to adjust the top strap so the headset sits comfortably above your nose, and doesn't slide down your face.

If the image is blurry, adjust the IPD by rotating the IPD wheel on the bottom of the headset until the image is clear. While doing this, a number will appear on the screen, keep note of this number for future sessions, to make entering VR easier for you.

Once the headset is comfortable, stand on the + (plus) in the center of the room and enter the headset. You will be greeted with a view of the surrounding room in pass-through mode.

From here, click the right `Meta` button on your controller to open the dashboard.
