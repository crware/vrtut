# Vive XR Elite Getting Started

First time set-up of the XR Elite is easy, let's jump into it.

To begin, loosen the headset by rotating the dial on the back of the headset counter-clockwise.

Place the headset over your eyes, but do not tighten the strap yet.

If the image appears blurry, take off the headset and adjust the `diopter dials` until the image appears clear. This may take a few tries, and depends on your glasses prescription. 

If the image appears clearly, but things still don't look quite right (i.e. "cross-eyed", or still blurry), adjust the IPD by moving the IPD slider on the bottom right of the headset. Adjust this until the lines appearing on the screen are clear. 

Take note of both of the diopter dial numbers, and the IPD number (that appears on screen), for future sessions. This will speed up the setup process.

Once you have dialed-in your settings, tighten the headset by rotating the dial on the back of the headset, clockwise, until comfortable.

Turn on both controllers by holding down the `Settings` (Left) and `Vive` (Right) buttons until they vibrate once.

Once in VR, point and click on the SimX Focus icon on the dashboard to launch SimX.
